    <p>1. Programming<br> I like to spend some of my free time programming small projects to keep my skills sharp.
    One example of this would be the program I wrote the other day. My program turned AM/PM time into military time.</p>
    <p>2. Pastry Dining<br> Finding and eating different pastries is another way I enjoy spending time. When I was young
    my brother and I would always get to eat a donut once a month. Because this was a rare treat we always wanted to sample 
    a different donut to try and find the perfect donut. Now I can eat donuts whenever I want, although I shouldnt eat them
    too often, but I still search for that elusive perfect donut as a reminder of the good times with my brother.</p>
    <p>3. Bird Watching <br> This hobby is harder to spend time doing, but anytime there is a good break in school or work
    I like to go out into the wilderness to watch natures feathered beauties. My favorite bird to watch is the bald eagle.</p>
